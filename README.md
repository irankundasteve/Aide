# standard (Android Kotlin music app)

`standard` is a Kotlin + Jetpack Compose Android music app starter with features typically expected in a modern demo player:

- Library view with curated tracks
- Stream playback with ExoPlayer
- Search by title, artist, or mood
- Favorites section
- Bottom now-playing bar with play/pause

## Run

1. Open in Android Studio (Hedgehog+ recommended)
2. Let Gradle sync
3. Run `app` on emulator/device (minSdk 26)

> The sample tracks stream from SoundHelix over the network.
